          Our purpose lies in empowering architects with a plethora of design
          options within milliseconds. From homeowners trying to DIY, to urban
          planners shaping cities, GPLAN streamlines the process of floor
          planning for all. So, architects save time and concentrate on other
          aspects of construction, completing projects on time.

          In 2014, the founder, Prof. Shekhawat had an interview with Prof. Mark Goulthorpe, Associate Professor at Dept. of Architecture, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), for a Postdoctoral Position. Prof. Goulthorpe was developing a project with the concept of Design-Yourself-a-House and on boarded Prof. Shekhawat. The idea didnâ€™t progress further due to lack of funding, but it remained with Prof. Shekhawat.

          Prof. Krishnendra Shekhawat has completed his PhD in Mathematics from University of Geneva
          in the guidance of Prof. Daniel Coray. During his PhD, he has also worked with Prof. Pierre
          Pellegrino on an Architecture Design Project. After finishing the PhD work, he joined
          Department of Architecture (Design & amp; Computational Lab) at University of Lisbon to work as a
          Postdoctoral Fellow in the guidance of Prof. Jose Pinto Duarte. Presently, he is an Associate
          Professor at Department of Mathematics, BITS Pilani, India. Last year, he is appointed as
          Scientific Advisor to Digital Blue Foam, Singapore. He has published many research papers in
          the field of Computer-aided Architectural Design, mainly focusing on Automated Generation of
          Floorplan Layouts. A few of them are as follows:
