          Users who wish to cancel their subscription must submit a formal
          request via email to our support team at support@gplan.in. This
          request must be received at least 10 days in advance of the next
          billing cycle to ensure timely processing. Failure to comply with this
          time frame may result in continued service and billing for the
          upcoming period.
        </p>
        <h2>Processing of Cancellation Requests</h2>
        <p>
          Upon receiving your cancellation request, our support team will verify
          the request and confirm cancellation within a maximum of 3 business
          days. The account will remain active until the end of the current
          billing cycle, after which the subscription will be terminated. You
          will continue to have access to your account and services during this
          period, and no refunds will be issued for any remaining time on the
          subscription.
        </p>
        <h2>Reactivation of Account</h2>
        <p>
          If users wish to reactivate their account after cancellation, a new
          subscription will need to be purchased, and previous data or settings
          may not be recoverable. Any unpaid dues or outstanding charges must be
          cleared before reactivating the account.
        </p>
        <h2>Billing and Termination</h2>
        <p>
          If the cancellation request is not submitted at least 10 days in
          advance, you may be charged for the subsequent billing cycle. After
          the cancellation is processed, the account will be deactivated, and
          access to the platform and associated services will be revoked. Users
          are responsible for ensuring the accuracy and timeliness of their
          cancellation request.
        </p>
        <h2>Eligibility for Refund</h2>
        <p>
          If you are an individual user and are dissatisfied with our Service,
          you are eligible for a full refund provided that you submit a written
          notice via email to{" "}
          <a href="mailto:support@gplan.in">support@gplan.in </a> within 10 days
          of your payment. This refund applies only to the specific transaction
          in question. Refund requests submitted after the 10-day period will
          not be honored, and you will have no right to a refund for that
          payment.
        </p>
        <h2>Refund Request Process</h2>
        <p>
          Refund requests must be sent to{" "}
          <a href="mailto:support@gplan.in">support@gplan.in</a> with a detailed
          explanation of why you are requesting the refund. Upon receiving your
          written notice, our support team will acknowledge the request and
          initiate the refund process. We reserve the right to review and
          validate the request before processing the refund. If approved, the
          refund will be issued within 7 business days from the date of
          approval.
        </p>
        <h2>Non-Refundable Services</h2>
        <p>
          Any requests for refunds made after the 10-day window will be
          automatically denied. Additionally, if you have already consumed a
          substantial portion of the service or violated the Terms of Service,
          we reserve the right to deny your refund request. Refunds will not be
          issued for any partially consumed services, add-ons, or optional
          features beyond the core subscription.
        </p>
        <h2>Refund Method</h2>
        <p>
          Refunds will be processed using the same method of payment originally
          used for the transaction. Depending on your payment provider, it may
          take 5-10 business days for the refunded amount to appear in your
          account. We are not responsible for any delays caused by third-party
          payment processors or banks.
        </p>
        <h2>Effect of Cancellation</h2>
        <p>
          If you request a refund within the 10-day window and it is approved,
          your account will be cancelled, and access to the Service will be
          revoked. You will no longer be able to use any features of the Service
          once the refund has been processed.
